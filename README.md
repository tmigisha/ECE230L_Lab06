## Lab Questions
* We learned about combinatorial logic and how to use it for basic number addition.
* Learned about real-life applications of an XOR gate, i.e. a staircase.

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
* Combine with more full adders.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
* It determines the sum, so that in the case where we are adding 1 and 1, we don't get 1 but 0 with a carry out. 

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
* Largest number = 110 (6). When you go over, you could get an incorrect answer for the addition.
